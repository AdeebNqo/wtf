wtf
===========

I 'ssh' to a server almost all the time. I also happen to use
cvlc to listen to music on the server. I have a couple of mp3
files I've stored on the server. I sometimes forget which song belongs
to who, as in I forget the artist,etc --- most of mp3 files are not labelled.


smallTagzz is a small python commandline application that uses
id3 tags. It reads tags and displays the artist name, album, etc of a
given mp3 file

Usage
------
This is a command line thing. Start by compiling it


		make


After compiling, install it


		make install


If you wake up and realize you don't need it


		make uninstall


Output
-------

After it has been installed. Say you happen to see an .mp3 file in some folder.
Enter the cmd: wtf.py xxx.mp3

Here's some output when its being run with a random mp3 file in my music directory

		Artist: Bruno Mars
		Title: When I Was Your Man
		Album: Unorthodox Jukebox
		Year: 2012
